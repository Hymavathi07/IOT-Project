# Automatic Street Light Control System - Minor Project



## Project Overview

Title: Enhancing Energy Efficiency and Safety through Automatic Street Lighting
Context: Urban areas require effective nighttime lighting for safety. Traditional systems, often controlled manually or by timers, can be inefficient, leading to increased energy use, higher costs, and safety risks.



## Abstract

This project focuses on developing an Automatic Street Light Control System that uses transistors as switches to control street lights based on ambient light levels. The system, employing Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) and Infrared (IR) sensors, automatically activates lights only when needed, reducing energy consumption. The project covers the design, implementation, and testing of the system, which eliminates the need for manual operation.




## Introduction

Street light controllers automate ON-OFF operations using sensors instead of manual or timer-based systems. This project uses a transistor and LDR to switch street lights on at dusk and off at dawn, optimizing energy use. IR sensors detect motion to ensure lights are only on when necessary.



## Basic Principle

The system uses LDRs to detect ambient light and IR sensors to detect motion. The LDR sends signals to an Arduino Uno, which controls the lights based on light levels and motion detection, ensuring efficient energy use and safety in public spaces.
